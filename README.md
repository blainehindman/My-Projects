### College Football Playoffs: A Better Version of the Rankings

A comprehensive reimagining of the college football playoff ranking system. This project provides a more accurate and transparent ranking methodology, ensuring fairer outcomes for teams. Leveraging advanced analytics and custom algorithms, it delivers improved insights compared to traditional approaches.

- **CFP_Multiprocessing**
  Implements parallel computing concepts to enhance the efficiency of ranking calculations.
  Uses multiprocessing for tasks like team scoring and schedule strength evaluations.
  Optimized for large datasets to ensure faster execution without compromising accuracy.
- **CFP_Playoffs**
  Focuses on conference champions and reseeding for the top 12 teams.
  Automatically grants auto-bids to conference champions while maintaining competitive fairness.
  Simulates the playoff structure, including first-round matchups and byes.
  Provides a transparent view of playoff seeding, matchups, and results.
- **CFP_Rankings**
  Produces top 50 rankings based on custom algorithms.
  Combines record points, offense and defense performance, strength of schedule (SoS), and other metrics.
  Designed to ensure accurate and transparent evaluations of team performances.

### Data Privacy & Protection: Encryption Project

A comprehensive system demonstrating best practices in data encryption, key management, and PII protection. This project is organized into **Asymmetric Encryption** (RSA) for secure key exchange and **Symmetric Encryption** (Fernet) for data confidentiality. It includes a mock KeyVault for key management and a mock database for encrypted PII storage.

- **Asymmetric Encryption (RSA)**: Securely encrypts and exchanges keys or small amounts of data.
- **Symmetric Encryption (Fernet)**: Encrypts larger datasets for storage or transmission.
- **Key Management**: Simulated KeyVault ensures secure and isolated key handling.
- **Mock Database**: Stores encrypted sensitive data, ensuring privacy and security.

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Secure SSN Transmission and Storage System

A secure system for transmitting, encrypting, and storing Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to prevent data loss. This project uses TLS/SSL for secure transmission and AES encryption for robust storage in a SQLite database.

- **Secure Transmission**: TLS/SSL ensures encrypted communication using self-signed certificates.
- **AES Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data before storage in a secure database.
- **Random SSN Generation**: Creates fake SSNs for testing workflows without handling real data.
- **DLP Practices**: Protects sensitive data at rest and in transit, preventing unauthorized access.

### FIZ Makerspace Upgrade

I led a significant upgrade of the FIZ Makerspace in Dana Hall, transforming it into a state-of-the-art facility with Industry 4.0 compatibility. Key accomplishments include:

- **RFID Authentication**: Integrated RFID-based security to ensure only trained users can access machinery, enhancing safety and accountability.
- **Data Logging**: Implemented a robust data-logging system to monitor machine usage, enabling proactive maintenance and maximizing operational efficiency.
- **Web Application & Database**: Developed a comprehensive web application and database system to automate safety protocols and manage user and machine data seamlessly.

This upgrade not only improved operational workflows but also aligned the Makerspace with the latest technological standards.
